<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>
You must write all the code you hand in for 6.5840, except for code
that we give you as part of assignments. You are not allowed to
look at anyone else's solution, and you are not allowed to look at
solutions from previous 6.5840 or 6.824 years. You may discuss the assignments with
other students, but you may not look at or copy each others' code. The
reason for this rule is that we believe you will learn the most by
designing and implementing your lab solution yourself.

<p>
Please do not publish your code or make
it available to current or future 6.5840 students.
<tt>github.com</tt> repositories are public by default, so please
don't put your code there unless you make the repository private. You
may find it convenient to use
<a href="https://github.mit.edu/">MIT's GitHub</a>,
but be sure to create a private repository.
