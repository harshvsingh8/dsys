<h1>Lab guidance</h1>

<h2>Hardness of assignments</h2>
  
<p>Each lab task is tagged to indicate
roughly how long we expect the task to take:
  <ul>
    <li><p><span class="easy">Easy</span>: A few hours.</li>
    <li><p><span class="moderate">Moderate</span>: ~ 6 hours (per week).</li>
    <li><p><span class="hard">Hard</span>: More than 6 hours (per week). If
    you start late, your solution is unlikely to pass all tests.</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>Most of the labs require only a modest amount of code
(perhaps a
few hundred lines per lab part), but can be conceptually difficult
and may require a good deal of thought and debugging.
Some of the tests are difficult to pass.

<p>Don't start a lab the night before it is due; it's more
efficient to do the labs in several sessions spread over multiple
days. Tracking down bugs in distributed systems is difficult,
because of concurrency, crashes, and an unreliable network.

<h2>Tips</h2>

<ul>
  
<li>Do the <a href="http://tour.golang.org/">Online Go tutorial</a> and
  consult
  <a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">Effective Go</a>.
    See <a href="https://golang.org/doc/editors.html">Editors</a> to
    set up your editor for Go.
  
<li>Use Go's <a href="https://blog.golang.org/race-detector">race detector</a>, with <tt>go test -race</tt>. Fix any races it reports.


<li>Read this <a href="https://thesquareplanet.com/blog/students-guide-to-raft/">guide</a>
  for Raft specific advice.

<li>Advice on <a href="raft-locking.txt">locking</a> in labs.

<li>Advice on <a href="raft-structure.txt">structuring</a> your Raft lab.

<li>
This <a href="../notes/raft_diagram.pdf">Diagram of Raft interactions</a> may
help you understand code flow
between different parts of the system.

<li>It may be helpful when debugging
to insert print statements when a
peer sends or receives a message, and collect the output in a file
with
<tt>go test &gt; out</tt>.  Then, by studying the trace of
messages in the <tt>out</tt> file, you can identify where your
implementation deviates from the desired behavior.

<li>Structure your debug messages in a consistent
format so that you can use <tt>grep</tt> to search for specific
lines in <tt>out</tt>.

<li>You might find <tt>DPrintf</tt> useful instead of
  calling <tt>log.Printf</tt> directly to turn printing on and off as
  you debug different problems.

<li>Learn about Go's <tt>Printf</tt>format strings:
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/">Go format strings</a>.

<li>You can use colors or columns to help you parse log output.
    <a href="https://blog.josejg.com/debugging-pretty/">This post</a> 
    explains one strategy.

<li> To learn more about git, look at the
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git book</a> or the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">git user's manual</a>.

<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p>Efficient debugging takes experience. It
helps to be systematic: form a hypothesis about a possible cause of the
problem; collect evidence that might be relevant; think about the
information you've gathered; repeat as needed. For extended debugging
sessions it helps to keep notes, both to accumulate evidence and to
remind yourself why you've discarded specific earlier hypotheses.

<p>
One approach is to progessively narrow down the specific point in
time at which things start to go wrong. You could add code at various
points in the execution that tests whether the system has reached the
bad state. Or your code could print messages with relevant state
at various points;
collect the output in a file, and look through the file for the first
point where things look wrong.

<p>
The Raft labs involve events, such as RPCs arriving or timeouts
expiring or peers failing, that may occur at times you don't expect,
or may be interleaved in unexpected orders. For example, one peer may
decide to become a candidate while another peer thinks it is already
the leader. It's worth thinking through the "what can happen next"
possibilities.
For example, when your Raft code releases a mutex, the
very next thing that happens (before the next line of code
is executed!) might be the delivery (and processing) of
an RPC request, or a timeout going off. Add Print statements to find
out the actual order of events during execution.

<p>
The Raft paper's Figure 2 must be followed fairly exactly. It is easy
to miss a condition that Figure 2 says must be checked, or a state
change that it says must be made. If you have a bug, re-check that all
of your code adheres closely to Figure 2.

<p>
As you're writing code (i.e., before you have a bug), it may be worth
adding explicit checks for conditions that the code assumes to be
true, perhaps using Go's
<a href="https://gobyexample.com/panic">panic</a>. Such checks may
help detect situations where later code unwittingly violates the
assumptions.

<p>
If code used to work, but now it doesn't, maybe
a change you've recently made is at fault.

<p>
The bug is often in the very last place you think to look, so be
sure to look even at code you feel certain is correct.

<p>
The TAs are happy to help you think about your code during office
hours, but you're likely to get the most mileage out of limited office
hour time if you've already dug as deep as you can into the situation.
