<h3>Handin procedure</h3>

<p>
Before submitting, please run all tests one final time.
</p>

<p>
Use the <tt>make lab<i>n</i><i>p</i></tt> command to package your lab
assignment and upload the generated tarball <tt>lab<i>n</i><i>p</i>-handin.tar.gz</tt>
to <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/503078">Gradescope</a>.
<i>n</i> is the lab number (i.e., 1, 2, 3, or 4) and <i>p</i> the part
(e.g, A, B, or C), if the lab is in parts.

<p>For example:
<pre>
$ cd ~/6.5840
$ make lab1
</pre>

Or:
<pre>
$ cd ~/6.5840
$ make lab2b
</pre>


<p>Before you submit a later part, make sure the earlier parts still work.
That is run, all tests through the part you are submitting.
</p>

<p class="note">
You may submit multiple times. We will use the timestamp of
your <strong>last</strong> submission for the purpose of
calculating late days.
