** Task - Raft Election 

#+BEGIN_SRC 
Implement Raft leader election and heartbeats (AppendEntries RPCs with no log entries). 
The goal for Part 3A is for a single leader to be elected, for the leader to remain 
the leader if there are no failures, and for a new leader to take over if the old 
leader fails or if packets to/from the old leader are lost.
