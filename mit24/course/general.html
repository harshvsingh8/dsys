<p><h2>Structure</h2>

<p>6.5840 is a core graduate subject with
lectures, labs, an optional project, a mid-term exam, and a final exam.
12 units,  6 EDPs.
</p>

<p>Class meets TR1-2:30 in person in E25-111.
Most class meetings will be part lecture
  and part paper discussion.  You should read the paper <i>before</i>
  coming to class, and be prepared to discuss it.
  The <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a> indicates the paper to read
  for each meeting.

<p>
We will post a question about each paper 24 hours before the beginning
of class on the <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a> (see the Question
link for each paper).  Your answer need only be long enough to
demonstrate that you understand the paper; a paragraph or two will
usually be enough.  We won't give feedback, but we will glance at your
answers to make sure they make sense, and they will contribute to your
grade.  For each lecture you must also submit your own question about
the paper.

<p>6.5840 will have a midterm exam during the ordinary lecture time,
  and a final exam during finals week.
  You must attend both exams.
  There will be no make-up or alternate conflict time for the midterm
  exam. 

<p>There are programming labs due every week or two throughout the term.
These labs are to be done <i>individually</i>.

<p>Towards the end of the term you can choose between doing a final
<a href="project.html">project</a> based on your own ideas, or doing <a href="labs/lab-shard.html">Lab 5</a>.  If you
want to do a project, you must form a team of two or
three people, the project must be closely related to 6.5840 topics,
and we must approve it in advance. You'll hand in a short project proposal, and,
if we approve, you'll design and build a system; at the end of the
term you'll hand in a summary of your results (which we'll post)
and your code, and do a short
presentation and demo in class.

<p>
To do well in 6.5840, you should already be familiar with computer
systems to the level of 6.033 (or 6.1810) and 6.004, and you should be good at
debugging, implementing, and designing software, perhaps as a result
of taking programming-intensive courses such as 6.1810 and 6.035.

<!-- RULE: grading -->
<p><a name="grading">
<hr>
</a>

<p><h2>Grading</h2>

Final course grades will be based on: <br>
<UL>
    <LI>50% labs (programming assignments), including optional project
    <LI>20% mid-term exam
    <LI>20% final exam
    <li>10% paper question answers and your own questions about papers
</UL>

<p>
To help you cope with unexpected emergencies, you can hand in your Lab
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5A
solutions late, but the total amount of lateness summed over all the
lab deadlines must not exceed 72 hours. You can divide up your 72 hours
among the labs however you like; you don't have to ask or tell us.
You can only use late hours for Labs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5A; you cannot
use late hours for Lab 5B or for any aspect of the project.

<p>
If you hand a lab in late, and your total late time (including
the late time for that assignment) exceeds 72 hours, and you hand it
in by the last day of classes, then we'll give it half the credit we
would have given if you had handed it in on time. Please send us
e-mail if you want us to grade an assignment that's more than 72 hours
late. We will not accept any work after the last day of classes,
regardless of late hours. If you don't hand in an assignment by the
last day of classes, we'll give the assignment zero credit.

<p>
If you want an exception to
these rules, please ask S3 to send us an excuse note.

<hr>

<p><h2>COVID procedures</h2>

<p>
If you cannot attend lectures in person, please watch
the recorded lectures to keep up with the material.
Office hours via Zoom will be available for those who
prefer them or who cannot attend in person.

<p>
We plan to have in-person exams. Please e-mail us as soon as possible
if you won't be able to attend because you have COVID or are isolating
in accordance with MIT rules, and we will make alternate arrangements
for you.

<hr>

<p><h2>Collaboration policy</h2>

<p>
You must write all the code you hand in for the programming assignments,
except for code that we give you as part of the assignment. You are
not allowed to look at anyone else's solution.
You may discuss the
assignments with other students, but you may not look at or use
each other's code.

<p>
Please do not publish your code or make
it available to current or future 6.5840 students.
<tt>github.com</tt> repositories are public by default, so please
don't put your code there unless you make the repository private. You
may find it convenient to use
<a href="https://github.mit.edu/">MIT's GitHub</a>,
but be sure to create a private repository.

<p>
You may discuss the paper questions with other
students, but you may not look at other students' answers.  You must
write your answers yourself.
